# web-database-and-emailling
This is the test I did for programming job. The files and codes were initially auto-generated by a software called Jetbrains PhpStorm, so it provided anything that basically needed to create a website. However, I only need a simple form and codes for database and emailing, thus I did not use all the codes and files. 

I am an amateur in programming so maybe my codes are inefficient and have some error. If you notice some of them, please edit and tell me. Can also email me for any question at syafiqnasir118@gmail.com
